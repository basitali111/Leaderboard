Project requirements
IMPORTANT NOTE This is the first time you will use Gitflow. Keep that in mind!
Create an npm project with webpack. (If you need a refresher, check the previous project or webpack exercise).

Don't make API calls (you'll do it in a following lesson).

Built With
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Used Webpack as bundler
Icons from FontAwesome
(Used Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint, and ESLint as linters)
Live Demo
You can check a live working version of this project here: live-demo

Getting started
This project makes use of Webpack to bundle all the JS modules, and FontAwesome icons.

Setup
Clone the repository into your local machine and then run npm install to download all the dependencies. Then after making any changes inside the src/ folder, you can run npm run build to generate the corresponding files inside dist/ directory.

Run tests
If you want to test your changes on the fly without having to build every time, you can use npm run start to start the webpack-dev-server in development mode. This will watch for any changes you make and update the page accordingly.

To run the test files just run npm test.

To check the linters on your local env, make sure you have installed all dependencies (npm install) and then copy and paste the following files inside the root of the project: .hintrc, .stylelintrc.json, and .eslintrc.json.
