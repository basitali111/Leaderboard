# Getting started
This project makes use of Webpack to bundle all the JS modules.

# Setup
Clone the repository into your local machine and then run npm install to download all the dependencies. Then after making any changes inside the src/ folder, you can run npm run build to generate the corresponding files inside docs/ directory.

# Run tests
If you want to test your changes on the fly without having to build every time, you can use npm run start to start the webpack-dev-server in development mode. This will watch for any changes you make and update the page accordingly.

To check the linters on your local env, make sure you have installed all dependencies (npm install). The files .eslintrc.json .hintrc and .stylelintrc.json contain the configuration files for the linters.
